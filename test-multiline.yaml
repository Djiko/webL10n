# A note on multiline values: in our YAML-like syntax, the `|' or `>' token is
# *required* for multiline values

# These two lines are equivalent
luckyNum: Your lucky number is: {{num}}
luckyNum: |
  Your lucky number
  is: {{num}}
 
# This throws a parsing exception, because we didn't explicitly passed `|` nor
# `>` and only expect nested attributes on following lines -or- a sibling
# key/value
luckyNum:
  Your lucky number
  is: {{num}}
 
# Plural form, with nested attributes:
luckyNum[plural(n)]:
  one: One number
  many: Many numbers
